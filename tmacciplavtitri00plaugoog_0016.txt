PREFACE.

Tua Syndics of the University Press asked me to
undertake this edition of the Trinummus primarily no doubt
because the play is required for a University Examination
in 1898. This fact will explain the presence of the more
elementary notes, which are most numerous on the earlier
portions of the text The requirements, however, of more
advanced students have not been forgotten, and for their
benefit references have been given to various standard works.
The Text is based on the new Teubner text of Goetz and
Schoell (Ieipzig 1896), departures from which are more
numerous than important. From Goetz and Schoell are
also taken the convenient signs, [ ] to mark letters or words
given by the MSS. but not wanted—it is right to say that
superfluous letters have not always been retained where the
correction seemed to be quite certain and the corruption
uninstructive-( ) to enclose verses that appear to have been
foisted into the text 3 < > to deuote letters or words not
given by the MSS. but required. Where the words or letters
so supplied are purely conjectural they are printed in italics.

The mark Ι calls attention to hiatus, remarkable but not
necessarily inadmissible. The Notes are to a very large
extent drawn from Brix, either Brix's own third edition
(1879) or the fourth edition re·edited by Max Niemeyer
(1888). I have found Ussing useful for both Text and
N otes, W. Wagnefs edition has occasionally proved helpful,
the new text of F. Leo (Berlin, 1896) has been consulted
