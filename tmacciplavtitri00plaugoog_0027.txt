xviii INTRODUCTION

reckoned as short, probably because in popular pronunciation-
the long unemphasised syllable was found heavy and incon-r
venient. Thus we get ddml, bools, fdrls,-a number of im·
peratives tene, abl, uide, &c Such words Ennius brought back

to their iambic scansion, and only left the short scansion in such
cases as bene, male ; the variable scansion in such as mihi, tibi,

sibi, ubi, uolo, &c This shortening by which iambic words
become pyrrhics is known as the Breues Breuiantes Law, see
Lindsay‚ Latin Language, p. aro. The words most affected are-
those ending in a long vowel, which are in conversation closely
joined with a following word, eg. nolli-scire, abl-rus, doml-restat,
&c

The regular rule in later Latin is that two consonants-
except a mute before a liquid—render a preceding vowel long
by position. Double letters in Plautus do not lengthena
vowel-especially ll. Ille, illic frequently have the first syllable
short This is specially frequent if a short monosyllable pre·
cedes (Miiller, Prosod. p. 330, would confine the usage to these
cases). But ll is neglected in caulllator, simlllimae‚ satellites,
publla, &c Ll in late Latin, as in modern Romance languages
had an obscure sound. Probably this was so in early Latin
and ll was only really sounded in the Augustan age. The
writing of double consonants was introduced by Ennius.

The same is found with the other liquids, annona, Inmortales,
lrridiculo-before ss, dedlsse, necesse, esse.

Position is also neglected before double mutes. hece isa
common case. So words compounded with it, eccum, eccam.
So also' ecquis, qulcquid, accepisti, decasio, beculto, sagltta,
adde, redde, &c

rn at the end of a word was more weakly sounded thanat
the beginning or in the middle of a word1. lt did not prevent
hiatus or the blending of vowels on either side of it by syna·
