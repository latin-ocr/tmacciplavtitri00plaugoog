and that he wrote the Pseudolus and Truculeutus as senex (C
Cato M. 50). The Pseudolus belongs apparently to 191 Β.
and Plautus to be called senex must then have been not lt
than 60 years of age. He died (Cic. Brut. 60) 184 rae Th
his literary activity includes the whole period of the Secot
Punic War and the time of Rome’s triumph after it.

His lise presents nothing but hard work, poverty, and m
fortune-a curious contrast to Terence with the favour ai
support of the great. Popular as his pieces were in the autho:
lifetime he gained his full recognition only after death-especial
from the death of Terence to nearly the end of the Republic

represented Italian provincial life. The strict police supervisi
and prohibition of politics or personalities made palliatae easi
to write and exhibit than togatae.) His originals were not t
