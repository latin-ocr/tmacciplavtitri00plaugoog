xl INTRODUCTION

Comedy Greek ideas about slavery had changed. Euri’
may be taken as the mouthpiece of liberal Athens on
subject (see lon 854, Hel. 728). ‘The slave·world was u

different; the Roman slave was a piece of household-fum'
the Attic slave was a servant. Where marriages of slaves

or a master carries on a kindly conversation with his slave,
Roman translatore ask their audience not to take offence
such things which are usual in Athens; and when ata '
period comedies began to be written in Roman costuma
part of the crafty servant had to be rejected, because the Ro
public did not tolerate slaves of this sort overlookiug
controlling their masters’ (Mommsen, 11. 432l·

There is no more striking proof that a foreign life is Ἰ
presented in Roman Comedy than the fact that whenever it
necessary to refer to a Roman law, a Roman cust0m‚ a Ro
poet, the Roman language, the thing is described in true G .
style as ‘barbarian'

This very representation of a life foreign to the audienoe
imposed many restrictione on the adapter. He must perforet
cut out all characters that would be incomprehensible toan
ordinary Roman. He must trim the conversation, the dishes
the jokes down to the level of his hearers. These remarks may
serve to explain at once why the treatment of the originals is so =
free and why the life described is so essentially un·Roman.

In one point of the treatment of slaves on the stage
Mommsen sees the hand of the adapter who is adding some
thing outside his original. ‘ln the endless abundance oi
cudgelling and in the lash ever suspended over the back oi
the slaves we recognise very clearly the household government
inculcated by Cato, just as we recognise the Catonian opposition
to women in the never-ending abuse of wives' (11. 435). The
criticism is true, if understood of the extent to which these things
are dwelt on-not of their presence in the plays together.

The whole of Mommsen’s two chapters on ‘F aith and
Manners' and ‘Literature and Art’ (11. 394-479) deserve close
attention from the student of Roman Comedy.
