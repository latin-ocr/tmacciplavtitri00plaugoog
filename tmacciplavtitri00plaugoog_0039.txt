contrasting them, by elevating subordinate into indepe
characters, by pourtraying the fortunes of the servants no ¹
than those oi their masters, and so forth. Thus we arec '
to the Shaksperian conception of plot-‘ the weaving of dis‘
stories into one common dramatic panem! See on this
R. G. Moulton’s Ancient Classical Drama, on which the
notes are mainly based.

10. T hc Τ tinummus. (1) The Trinummus is basedu
the Θησαυρόςοί Philemon (c. 330-262 nc), perhaps the greatest
Athenian lavourite among the poets ol the New Attic Comedy.

Plautus is fond of Philemon as a model. The Me
is drawn from Philemon’s Ἐμπορος, the Mostellaria from ‘
Φάσμα, the Casina from his Κληρούμενοι.

But in this as in other plays it would be a great mistake .

trunk is dragged ashore. There the original was the Πὴραοὶ
Diphilus, and the natural name Vidularia was out of mr
question because already appropriated to another play of similar
plot. It may be conjectured that the same thing has happened
here, ie. that the obvious name Thensaurus could not be used
by Plautus because it had already been attached to another
play.

The story briefly is this. An Athenian citizen Charmides
resolves to go abroad and trade, to better his fortunes impaired
by his son's extravagance. He entrusts his property, his son
Lesbonicus and his daughter, to the saie-keeping os his old
friend Callicles. Lesbonicus is a profligate, he wastes the
property and is finally obliged to sell even the house. In the'
