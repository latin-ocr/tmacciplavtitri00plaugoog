Nummus in Plautus when it is used without an adj. (aurem, Philip-
Μ), radere it refers teodesindum, is certainly a didrachmam, a two-
drachm piece. See Truc. 562 where quinque nammi=110 oi a mina, ie.
¹0 drachmae, whence nummus=r drachmae. And this is certainly the
regular 'meaning oi nummus in Plautus—in Terence it is used lor ‘a
drachma.’ But there are passages where the word appears to be used
simply in the sense ol ‘a coin’ Thus Capt. 331 eum si reddis milri,
praeterea unum nummum ne dua, Epid. 330 (amicir) nummum nullum
labes, Pseud. 13²3 him numquam eris nummo ditior, in all of which we
should say ‘a brass sarthing’ or ‘a cent'rx The ar and the denarias are
mentioned neither in Plautus nor Terence, and we must think only oi
Greek coins.) Brix and others argue that three two-drachm pieces isan
incredibly large sum ior the Sycophant to have received lor so easy a
task as delivering two lorged letters. They compare Most. 357 abr· runt
...isti qui hosticas trium nummum causa subeunt sub salas? which de·
preciates the sum whatever it is. But the tesk, if easy, was confidential,
and the Sycophant had to be paid lor his silence. He is evidently
hugely delighted with his luck. He speaks contemptuously of the sum
ol course, ‘tribus nummis’ ‘a piece or two ¹-see on v. 791. But in view
of the necessity ol purchasing his silence and hisevidentdelight,1do
not think six drachmae an incredible sum, and would give nummus its
ordinary Plautine meaning. Ussing argues from the singular Trinummo
that a single coin is meant equivalent in value to the tribus nammis of
the next line. He thinks an Attic tetradrachmon, which weighed
almost as much as three staters, may be meant. If Ussingis right, as 1
think he is, in his idea that Trinummus isone piece ol money equiva-
lent to the tres nummi of the next line, there are great difficulties in the
way ol translating ‘three cents’ or the like. And in any case the con·
temptuous depreciation lies in tribus, not in nunrmr's. The Sycophant
‘has hired out his services to lie and swindle ‘lor just one or two pieces‚'
‘mere three, only three pieces‚’ not lor ‘three paltry pieces‚' The nummi
may be valuable coin, only it is a pity he has not got more ol thern.
