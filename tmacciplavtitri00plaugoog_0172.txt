sc ιιι] NOYES. ¹27

relative sentence by antiptosis, and the relative sentence is not strictly
dependent (actum est, not actum sit). See note on v. 373 and cf.
Capt. 206 scimm nas nastrum officium quod cst. ln Plautus the para-
tactic indic. is the ordinary use after familiar colloquial phrases such ns
uiae, uiden? oudin? followed by ut, qua mado irc, eg. Aul. 46 illuc
sis utile, ut incedit, Merc. ι69 hoc sis uide, ut palpatur, Men. 920 audin
tu ut delirammta loquitur? Pseud. 152 hoc sis utile, ut alias res agiant.

dchanged to r. See Lindsay, L. L. p. ⁵¹⁷·

scillcet, ‘without faih’ Sci-licet corresponds in sense to scire licet,
which Lucretius uses in full, at the same time employing scitica as its
equivalent eg. 11. 4⁶9 scilicet csse globosa. The history of ilicet and
uideb'cet is the sanie, and hence their use with acc. and infin, eg.
Curc. 263 item alios deas facturas scilicet ‘you may be sure the other
gods will do the same‚’ Capt. 4⁶9 ilicet parasiticae arti maxumam
malam crucem ‘the profession of the diner·0ut may go and hang itself,'
Asin. 599 esse negotiosum interdius uidelicet Solonem, ‘you can see that
by day he is abusy Solon! See Munro on Lucr. 1. 210. lhe words
ere formed directly from the verbal noun-stems, just as tenses are
formed. Sci-licet, ilicet, uma-ticet are precisely analogous to sci-bo,
ι- 'bo‚ ume- bo dic. Another less probable vrew derives the words from the
imperative, sci, licet: ‘,know you may.’

³80. corun, ‘that the day may be fixed for the wedding m person?
i. e. by a personal interview between you and Lysiteles.

⁵81. eadem,⁴ at the same time¹ 'always ιιι Plautus with the fut. οι
fut. perf. The pbrase' rs given in full, eadem opera, ‘with the same -
trouble,’ Asin. 640, Bacch. 60, Capt. 450, Most. 1039. similaris una
apem, ‘just as well, ‘you might as well,’ Asin. 99, Pseud. 319. But
una opera isalso used in the same sense as eadem. Roby, L. G. 1237.

cet. memoratissimum egotam blo ero, ‘mind you seeto
what Ι told you ι I’ll be back directly! This is addressed to Stasimus
by Lesbonicus, and refers to his previous orders, vv. 577-579. The
line¹ is defective: it may be filled up by curato bem in place of cura, but
emendation is not necessary, for, as Leo says, the line has been added to
enable the 'rest of the scene to be omitted.

ego lem bic ero, ‘'Ill be back here directly rs regularly used by‘a
person just quitting the stage.

ιιι. quin tu 1 modo-1 modo-abt nodo. With Stasimus’ haste
ιο get Lesbonicus to go, cf. Mero. 954, 955, where Charinus presses
Eutychus with' i modo...i mado...quin tu ergo ι 'moda
