xxxviii INTRODUCTION.

12. The Lrse deputed in tlte Play. The social conditione
implied by the piece, particularly so far as the slaves are con·
cemed, contrast so strongly with what we know of the grauitas
of Roman family life that some explanation is necessary. Cato
the Elder best typifies the mode in which the private life of a
respectable Roman citizen should be spent. ‘His domestic
discipline was strict. The servants were not allowed to leave
Ι the house without orders, or to talk of what occurred in the
household to strangers. The more severe punishments were not
inflicted capriciously‚ but sentence was pronounced and exe·

cuted after a quasi-judicia] procedure : the strictness with which
offences were punished may be inferred from the fact, that one

of his slaves who had concluded a purchase without orders from
his master hanged himself on the matter coming to Cato’s ears.
F or slight offences, such as mistakes committed in waiting at
table, the consular was wont after dinner to administer to the
culprit the proper number of lashes with a thong wielded by his
own hand’ (Mommsen, 11. 405). Nothing could be more differ-
ent from this strict regime than the conduct of the slaves in the
Plautine plays, familiar and on an easy footing of intimacy with
their masters.

We cannot too carefully bear in mind that the plays put
upon the Roman comic stage were Greek in everything but their
language. No doubt they are full of Roman touches. The
tresuiri and the aediles are grotesquely mixed with agoranomi
and demarchi. The Athenian scenery does not prevent a sud-
den transportation for a few lines to the Capitol or the streets of
Rome. But in all essentials the plays are Greek. lt was inevi-
table that they should be so. In everything except politics
Greek influence was felt. The very work of education at Rome
was chiefly in the hands of slaves, freedmen, or foreigners, in
other words chiefly in the hands of Greeks or half-Greeks.
‘The Romans could no doubt leam to read and write Latin by
means of the Twelve Tables; but Latin culture presupposed a
literature, and no such literature existed at Rome? Besides
this the Roman popular festivals were throughout under
the influence of Greeks. There arose a demand for plays.
