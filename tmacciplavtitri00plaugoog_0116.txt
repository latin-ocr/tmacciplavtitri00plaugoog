88. mont niimterrogatiua, ‘whatl mei'

10. tene oblurlcemt ‘whether it is you‚’ 810.

tl. dicturum mule, 1011. by dat. mihimet, as male dicere, nec recte
naaman dicere 810. take dat. mihimet is the dat. strengthened by
-acc, as it sometimes is by pte, mihipte. Other similar forms are
mmet, manen, tibimet, temet. Met is found occasionally with posses-
tives in Plautus, but not in Cicero or Caesar. It is thus more a particle
for persoual than 101 possessive pronouns. But -ptc is common with

101501ςί1011, but almost exclusively with the abl„ as meopte ingenio, sarapte
·“ maa. See Lindsay, L. L. p. 429.

11. artes aunum tuae, ‘your good old ways! Antiquae ina
800d sense like vv. 295 and 381: anos=iacrndetaora So Ter. Andr.

e. inanimo, infr. v. 118, and moloe ortes, improbae artes often. aegro-
.’ ‘liliosa 30. The three lines which follow are spurious. The first is
Γ not found in Α. The second repeats the same thing in another way,
ε’ aaa the two lines cannot stand together. The third looks like an
mterpolated gloss. Eos is wealr, ast is very rare in Plautus, captare
”0²0⁸ mores is not a Plautine phrase. Further, mores is wrongly
ἓξ 111 the passage. The three lines may be sasely enclosed in
kets.

78. morbum tu menites mrtem: take this line as the apodosis
⁰s V· 72=‘y0n will produce in all your friends’ or ‘will inoculate all
7⁰¹1r friends with a serious dissidet-⁹ Callicles is spoken 01 as ithe
were highly infectious. The nature 01 the ‘disorder’ is explained by
¹¹¹² next line.

'ta nt te uiuere nudusque aaaron stent, ‘making them sick to
⁵²⁹ and hear yon'=at uisus ct auditus tuus iis armiro rit. The infin.
was merely a case (usually dat. or 100. sing.) 01 a verbal noun. Here
“sdermtuidoot audire=aadi·st, ie. they are 100. 110111 au ostem.
This origin ο1 the infin. will explain its use, known as the complementary
0‘ epexegetic infin, to detine or complete the meaning 01 an adj.‚ as
“Uati here. Cf. Merc. 188 non sum occupatus umquam amico operam

aare, ibid. 805 defessus sum urbem totam peruenarier. It will also
explain the soealled infin. 01 purpose, as inlr. v. 10¹5 recurre petere.
