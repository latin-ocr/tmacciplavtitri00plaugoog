We may suppose that Philemon had oinos, not γένος, when the figure
ol first fire and then water becomes much more natural. But the fire is
first destructive, v. 675, then necessary sor the maintenance oi the house
or iarnssy, v. 678. The water is meant to save, v. 676, but it destroys,

lesbonicus flies from extreme to extreme, and never thinks ol the happy
mean, the ideal oi Greek philosophy. See ior a discussion oi the passage
