INTRODUCTION. ⁴ xxi

s and t, as eris, eget, especially in the subjunctive, sit, fuat, uelit,
in the perf. uixIt, fuit, and the exact-future adduxerit

Third-dedension ablatives are often long when written e, as
well as when written i, eg. rete, carne, ordine, milite.

Ego has ὁ often—mihi, tibi, sibi often, modo sometimes,
immo always.

As might be expected there is some licence in dealing with
Greek words. Acheruns is scanned with the first syllable long.
Therapontigonus, Cure. 430, has the second syllable long.
trapezita often has the first syllable long-perhaps we should
in such cases with Ritschl write tarpessita

Greek proper names with ll are sometimes shortened, as
Callicles. AdJectives properly in aeus (=Greek -αιος which is
sometimes κῖκυς) carr be written eus and scanned eus, and
schema=oyfypa is in Amph. 117 schema

C. Vowels added and Synizesis.

ln the pronunciation of words Plautus and his contemporaries
at times (a) add a vowel for ease of pronunciation-especially
in new formatioris from the Greek, (b) subtract a syllable by
symzesrs.

a. (r) Thus u is added before l and m, i before n, when
these liquids follow k, p, t, m. ln some words this inserted
vowel has held its place at later periods of the language, eg.
Aesculapius (Ἀσκλήπως), Hercules (Ἡρακλῆς). Others in Plautus
are Alcumena, Tecumessa, drachuma, Procina, (lucinus (κύκνος),
techina (τέχνη), gyminasium (γυμνάσιον), and mina which sur-
vived This process is known as anaptyxzt and the parasitic
vowel as warabhakti.

ln true Latin words, as fauitores for fautoreS, purigare for
purgare, iurigare for iurgare, discipulina for disciplina, extem·
pulo for extemplo, the vowels are not ‘inserted’ but original.
See on this 1. Miiller, Hdb. iil. p. 277, Lindsay, L. L, p. 145 ff.

(2) But in neuter nouns, especially in -culum (cium), before
suffixes beginning with m and n, and adjectives ending in ·dus,
the short (original) form is commonet than the long form in
Plautus. Such are uinclum, periclum, saeclum, uehiclum; teg·
men, lamna, domnus ; caldus, soldus, ualde.
