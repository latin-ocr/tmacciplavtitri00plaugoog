INTRODUCTION. xxxvii

Aulularia the verses are delivered by Lar Familiaris, in the
Rudens by Arcturus, in the Trinummus by Luxuria Terence
used his Prologues for a polemical purpose, to gain the favour of
the audience and defend himself from the attacks of a rival poet.

lt is assumed that Prologues were at one time prefixed to
all the Plautine plays. The Bacchides, Epidicus, Mostellaria,
Persa, Stichus have none now. The Curculio has none but has
a sort of παράβασις in the Third Act. Only two lines survive of
the Prologue to the Pseudolus. ln the Miles and Cistellaria
the plot is explained in a scene of the First Act. But in the
Amphitruo and Mercator the Prologue is delivered by one of
the persons of the play. Yet the Prologues to the Amphitruo,
Captiui and Poenulus contain references to improvements in the
Theatre—seats dtu—which were not introduced until after the
death of Plautus: that to the Casina declares itselfpost-Plautine.
The Prologues to seven plays speak not of ‘poeta’ but Plautus
or Maccius, and belong to the revival of Plautiae study ‘in the
first half of the 7th cent. A.U.c.' Setting on one side the
Prologues to the Aulularia, Rudens and Trinummus1, we may
lay it down that the extant Prologues are post-Plautine.

ln any case the Prologue is no part of the play proper. lt is
not spoken by one of the characters but by an actor dressed for
the purpose—ornatu prologi.

These Prologues merely do what the modern programme or
play-bill serves to do. The constituent parts of the play proper
are diuerbium and cantica, see p. xxv. All iambic·scenes are
included as diuerbium ‘dialogue' They had no musical ac-
companiment. As cantica are included both lyn'cs proper and
scenes declaimed with musical accompaniment.

On the question of the Prologues generally see Ritschl
Parerga 1. 180-238, Liebig de prol. Ter. et Plaut. 1859,
Dziatzko de prol. Plaut. et Ter. 1864, Trautwein de prol. Plaut.
indole atque natura 1890.

¹ Trautwein adds Cistellaria, Miles, Mercator 3 and Leo (Plautinische
Forschungen‚ chap. lv.) goes further still. He includes as Plautine the
Prologue of the Asinaria, which has, he says, ‘all marks of being
genuine und original’
