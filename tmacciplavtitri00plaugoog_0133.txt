as his name derived from λυσιτελεῖν indicates, debates with himself ina
lyrical monologue (canticum) whether he shall pursue love and pleian
or property (πη-πμ). He expounds the ways of love. When lore
comes, property goes. The lover is a ruined man (235-255). He loces
credit and friends (256-265). bove then must be shunned. He resolvet
to lead a steady lile (266-275).

Such a canticum as this partly replaces the lost Chorus. The loss
ol the Chorus is also to some extent made up by the moralising tum
oi certain characters ina play, such as Lysiteles and his father Philto

here.

negotiations for his marriage.

viz. the marriage negotiations. Act 1. is concemed with the position .-
Callicles, Act ΙΙ. with the affairs of Lysiteles-these two stranda will ‚j
woven together in Act 111.

The metres in this canticum change with extraordinary rapidity-
Each change of subject and feeling is represented by a correspon‘ 35⁴

metres are probably as follows z-See Niemeyer‚ Kritischer Anhang, μ·
