Athenian ‘comedy The story is a well-drawn family history,
excellently told and regularly developed, the characters are all
typical and are sketched with care. The old men, Charmides,
> Callicles, Megaronides and Philto, are all distinct typeS, 3ηά
their characters are consistent and form effective contrasts.
The highly moral Lysiteles is an excellent foil to the spendthrist
but good-hearted Lesbonicus. The comic clement proper is
supplied by the slave Stasimus and the Sycophant

The play is disfigured by no grossness; it isa quiet play
(lenis, statarra, as contrasted with matoria a lively bustling
play, such as the Asinaria). lt is a remarkable feature that
the T rinummus, like the Captiui another moral play, has no
female character among the dramatis personae.

If we analyse the play we find that Act l. contains the
narrative of the facts as unfolded in the conversation between
Callicles and Megaronides. Act ll. introduces usto the family
of Philto and the proposal of marriage. Act 111. developes
the complications that arise on the unwillingness of Lysiteles
to impoverish his friend by accepting a dowry, and the
reluctance of Lesbonicus to allow his sister, and of Callicles
to allow his ward, to marry without a dowry. These complica-
tions are further complicated by the mission of the Sycophant.
Act IV. relates the discomfiture of the Sycophant, but leaves
Charmides till the end in uncertainty as to the true state of
things. With the explanation of Callicles the unravelling of
the difficulties begins. Act V. clears up the difficulties, and
all ends happily. Thus vv. 23—601 contain the exposita),
vv. doz-1092 the inuolutia (entanglement), vv. 1093—1189
the euolutia (disentanglemeut).

ln the structure of the play it should be noted that there are
two distinctinterests: (1) the difficult position of Callicles, (2) the
marriage negodiations, and that these two plots are worked
together side by side and for the most part kept distinct hythe
different metres employed for each. The Callicles plot is
worked in iambic metre, ie. as we should say in blank verset

the marriage plot is worked in lyrics or accelerated rhythm-
