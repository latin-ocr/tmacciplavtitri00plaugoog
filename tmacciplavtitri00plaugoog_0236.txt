not affected by Lysiteles' quid ego fect?

11666111111166 1161111616 aaran dac„ ‘if that twas done with
my consent, you have grounds for being angry with me.’ A gap is
marked after this line, the lost verses being supposed to oontain
Lysiteles’ explanation. But this single line implies sufficiently his
innocense, which we need not suppose him to be at pains to prove.
The spectators are aware of the facts, they know that with the best will
in the world Lysiteles could not have restrained Lesbonicus, and it is
in accordance with Plautus' custom to cut short such explanatione at the
end of the play. See on v. 1097. Lysiteles feels quite easy about him-
self, he is anxious to plead for his friend and does so at once. The
marks of the persons are disordered iu the uss. But there cannot be
any reason for making Callicles speak with Charmides. Their expla-
nation is over and done with. The interlocutor here must be Lysiteles.
Ussing and Goetz and Schoell make the speaker Callicles, but Niemeyer
and Leonte, Ι think, certainly right in assigning the dialogue on from
v. 1163 to Lysiteles.

1166. quta 61166666 66111111 a sign of violent emotiom whether anger
or, as here, sorrow. Cf. Asin. 403,Merc. 600. Charmides is greatly
moveri, he does not ‘shake his head' as we use the phrase, i.e. in the
, sense of refusing, as the next words shew.

deserve.'

1116. Lysiteles goes up to the door of the house and knocks. Les·
bonicus is in his posticulum, to which access from the stage is supposed
to be through the street-door of the house. See on v. 1085. But being
in the posticulum he known nothing of his father's arrival or subsequent
events.
