882 fuxo solu, see on v. 60.

804. numum facinus mctptsus perora, ‘a superhuman tnsk,’
‘something ol exceeding difficulty,' more grandiloquent than the usual
magna res. ef. Mil. 228 magnam illic honio rem incipissit.

aas. st ante lucem tre herde ooclptus a meo primusomne, ‘I
assure you that ifyou were to start before dawn on your joumey from the
beginning ol my name &c' There is gap with space ior six letters before
irc in B. I have provisionally inserted Ritscbl’s hercle after irc, which is
at least idiomatis, for the asseveration gets into the si clause, see on v.
457,butusuallycomesimmediatelyastersi. Niemeyer writesbitc' in place
of irc, but common as are periitne, interium, addicere, abicere, reticere,
we want evidence for a deponent form bitor. Prof. Palmer suggests ire
itere, ‘to go on ajourney.' A mco primo nominc, ‘from the beginning
of,' like prima uespera Cure. 4, primulo diluculo Amph. 737, prima nia
Mil. 253, digitulis primoribus Poen. 566 &c And so adpostrcmun, ‘to
the end ol it.'

concubium ult nontin ‘the dead of night.' Varro, L. L. v11. 78
concubium a concubitu dormiendi causa dr'ctum.

887. opus neuen multuo, ‘one must get travellingmoney for your
nume! Charmides enters into the Sycophant's humour. But facto is
probably not right: opuscst nchtc'n is the regular idiom, andis anything is
added it should be an adj. with the meaning of magno, as Wagner sug-
gens, such as sirmundi, or a participial adj. like pacto.

888. luxlllum B, nixillnm CB, nascnlum FZ. The latter is often
adopted, where nascnlum uinanum means ‘alittle wine-glass,’ uinarinm
being an adj. Another reading is ncscnlnm ninacium, where ncsculum
is ἅπαξ εἰρημένον, a diminutive of nescns ‘thin,¹ and ⁴nincrrium is used as
a noun, as it is Poen. 838, ‘a thin wine-jug! But these readings rio not
account r'or the reading of the better Mss. The best suggestion is
Ussing’S, who proposes uexillum uinarium, ‘a wine-label’ or ‘ticket’
The notae put on the casks might very well have had the shape of a
ncxc‘llum, and so get the name. And they would only contain a few
letters to indicate the wine contained in the cask, like the sillybi ol
books and our decantet-labels with their S. W„ 1. W. and so on.
These abbreviated descriptions would stand to the lull title in the same
relation as the Sycophant’s short name to his full name. Leo's note is
errasse cogitari potest dc ‘nin' qnasi nominc dcminnto (‘nugclprobe’)‚
which isperhaps right.

888. quid est un nomen? ‘what isyour name ?' We should expect
yuc'd id (istnc) cst nomen? without tibi, ‘what is thet name, the name
