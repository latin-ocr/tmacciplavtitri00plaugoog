Short notes on the chief metres only are here given.

The Iambic Senarius is the regular metre of dialogue, w

Greek lambics have accustomed us to the idea that the md,

But the Latin poets admitted spondees [--], and even ant·

iambus. The verse seldom ends with two iambi. Diomede
asserts that tragic poets always wrote a spondee in the §th ioot

There is no objection to dactyls [m] provided there an

Most licence is allowed in the first foot, where a mocclena}
matie [ν ν ν -], a bacchio [- - v), or a cretic [- ν -] is sometime '
found.

Penthemimeral is more common than hephthemimeral cae
sura. Hiatus is most common at the caesura.

The T rochaic Septenarius (tetrameter trochaicus catalecti-
cus) was employed when the speech was important or excited,
and is used by Plautus with great effect. There is a diaeresis
after the 4th foot which should coincide with the end of a word

. rare-a spondee can be used not only in and, 4th and 6th (as in
Greek), but in ist, 3rd and 5th.

The Latin admitted a dactyl instead of a spondee, save in
the 4th foot, where it is rare. A dactyl is most common in the
first loot.

The Iambic Septenarius (tetrameter iambicus catalecticus)
is a favourite comic metre. The treatment is the same as that
of the Senarius, except that, as there is a diaeresis aster the 4th
foot‚ that foot 3ηά the 7th ought to be pure. But tribrachs,
spondees and dactyls are found in the 7th foot.

octonarii, iambic and trochaic (ie. tetrametri acatalectici), are
used by Latin Comedians in highly excited scenes where great
