owner ’—qur'd mercedis petasus hodie domiuo demeret? Pers. 159, S. πόθεν
ornamenta? Τ. abs chorago sumito ,· dare debet: praebendo aediles locaue-
runt, Cure. 464 where a choragus is afraid he will never recover the
unamenta lent to a nugator. So choragium Capt. 61 is ‘stage-
properties‚’ ‘wardrobe’ suo periculo, so that he will have to replace
the costume is the Sycophant sails to return it.

86⁹. urcundum, ‘to swindle.' So v. 9595 see on v. 616. All
the verbs there mentioned are synonyms os spoliare aliquem aliquo, and
take the same construction.

tto. tubo oporam...seucur, ¹1 shall be doing my best to make
him see that 1 by myself really am a sycophant,’ ure ipsum, ‘in and by
myself‚’ without any instructions from him (v. 854) how to play the
part.

⁸⁶1. quam nam muto, minue paesu=qu0 magis specto, eo eniuus
placet. cf. Asin 158 quam magis...tom‚ Bacch. 1076 quam mgis...
magis, Men. 95 quam magis...tanto. Plautus does not use quo-eo.

mlru eunt nl and mirmu est ni with indic. and not ironical‚ see on
v. 495, ‘it is a wonder...is καί-(Ι am pretty sure...2's.’

88². dormitator here and v. 984 is taken to mean ‘thiel' a man
who sleeps by day that he may wake by night. Cf. Hesiod, Works 605
μή ποτε u’ ἡμερόκοιτος ἀνὴρ ἀπὸ χρήμαθ’ ἕλοιτο.

notor mnus, βαλοντιοτὸμος, ‘cut-purse’; ‘qui zonas nummorum
olenus secat! Zouarr'm should be spelt senarius (see on v. 42 5), as z was
not in use in Plautus’ day. But the Mss. often reflect the spelling ol a ’
later date, as in trapezitae v. 425, Syrorum v. 542 dc.

868. contemplat, non-deponent, see on v. 422: circumspectat se v.
146. Nascitur, ‘is taking stock of!

864. quo mox furatum ueniat, ‘he is reconnoitring the locality,
that he maycome to steal later on! Cf. Rud. ιιι au quo furatum
uenias, uestigat local, ibid. 417 acceptum hospitio, si mox uenies uesperi.

eto. magle, sc. quam antea, see v. 841. luuraosc=1ubetasv.626.

866. melones, ‘quarter’

tte. habet rectam ulam, ‘he is making straight for! So Mil. 491,
Pseud. 1136.

869. atltandumat uultus, ‘on my arrival at home 1 shall have to
keep watch t0·night.' This gerund construction is usual in early and
rome very late writers. Similarly Lucretius’ aeternas quoniam poenas
iu morte timendumst, and even with verbs which do not take an acc. as
imperandum est seruis. In the clessical period the gerundive is pre·
'erred when the verb governs an acc.. eg. Caesar and Cicero would say
