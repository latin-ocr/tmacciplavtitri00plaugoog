clelt's, forms attested by Charisius, p. 132. But as Callicli is the regular
Plautine gen. (v. 744) it is simplest with Hermann to insert huius alter
Callicli. Haec and liuius are then both used δεικτικῶς, laec pointing to
the house where the girl is, luitis to Callicles, who stands by Charmides’
side.

1188. iubebis, sc. ducere.

1188. unt. goes with miseria, ‘one afflictionis quite enough for one
mam’ This does not sound complinreutary to Mrs Chanuides‚ who is
not mentioned in the play, perhaps because her husband has had no

1188. optumumst, see v. 52. Licet ‘assentantis' is apparently a

n. The play like all the Plautine plays ends witha request ior
applause. That request is made in the single word plaudite here, Mil.
