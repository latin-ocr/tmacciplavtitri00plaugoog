INTROD UCTION. xxxix

The impatience of the people would not give the native Italian
dramatic elements time for development ‘The Romans desired
a theatre but the pieces were wanting! Literature cameto
Rome along with the sovereignty of the world.

Hence it came to pass that both education and literature
took stand on Greek ground. The school and the stage were
thoroughly anti-Roman. They were two of the strongest in·
fluences at work throughout the whole period in sapping Roman
conservatism at the most brilliant era it ever had.

The Roman police-regulations undesignedly fostered this
Hellenism. The Roman police allowed no politics on the stage.
Comedy was allowed to bring forward no Roman on the pulpi-

police-regulations at Rome that almost contemporaneously a
national comedy was introduced in the provincial towns. The
earliest composer of togatae known to us is Titinius. His pieces
also were based upon the N ew Attic Comedy: but with him it
was imitation, not translation. The scene was laid in Italy:
the actors appeared in the Italian dress (laga). The pieces really
dealt with ltalian life aad habits. The life represented was
usually that of southern Latian towns, Setia, Velitrae, Ferenti-

of anything except palliatae, in which, as has been said, there
was nothing really Latin save the language in which the play
was dressed.

And so the conditions of life depicted were Hellenic, cosmo-
politan, certainly not Roman. Before the time-of the New
