INTRODUCTIOM xxvii

at least five performers, the Poenulus and Rudens need six.
Ritschl conjectures seven in the Trinummus. Nor did the
Roman comedians guard against scenes in which more than
three characters spoke On this see P. Schmidt (Zahl der
Schauspieler bei Plautus und Terentius).

(c) The division of the play into Acts has been retained

for convenience, not because it was the original arrangement.
The law which prescribes that all plays should contain five

Acts and no more was unknown to the Greeks. Aristotle (Poet.
12) gives as the constituent parts of a tragedy πρόλογος, ἐπεισ-
όδιον, ἔξοδος, χορικόν. The number of ἐπεισόδια depends upon
the number of στάσιμα by which they are divided, and differs in
different plays. Thus, it we reckon πρόλογος and ἔξοδος as
Acts, there will be five Acts in the Prometheus Vinctus, Septem
c. Thebas, Agamemnon, Choephori, Eumenides; but four in
Euripides' Supplices, Heracleidae, Iphigeneia in Tauris, Rhesus;
six in Sophocles’ Ajax and Oedipus Tyrannus; seven in Sopho-
cles' Antigone, and in Euripides’ Medea and Hercules Furens.
The law is Alexandrine and is undoubtedly observed in post-
Alexandrine writers. But the Roman comedians knew nothing
of the division into Acts, nor of any fixed number os ActS,
nor do their MSS. shew any trace of such a division. Horace
(A. P. 189) first speaks directly os the regular five Acts, and
critics, eg. Donatus, frequently complain of the difficulty of
dividing the existing plays into Acts.
On the other hand the division into scenes is regularly found
ς in the MSS. os Plautus and Terence, and the names of the
l characters speaking in each are given as headings (tz'tule).
¹ The intervals between the scenes were filled up by the
p orchestra, especially by a favourite tibicen, or by the choragus.
, There is no change of scenery in the Plautine plays, and save
i for these short pauses filled up by simple music the play goes
' right on from the lowering os the curtain at the commencement
= to the raising at the close.
