xxxvi INTRODUCTION.

It has been already pointed out that the MSS. BCD are
closely connected. They all come from one original which was
perhaps a minuscule MS. of the 9th cent, which in turn must
have come from an archetype written in capitals, and pre-
sumably not later in date than the 5th cent. The text of this
archetype is known as the ‘Palatine' text, and BCD are referred
to as the ‘Palatine' MSS.

The discovery of the Ambrosian Palimpsest (A) gave a rival
text, the ‘Ambrosian' text as it is called. Had the whole of the
plays been preserved in A there would have been doubt about
the reading of very few lines. But unfortunately what we possess
is a mere fragment, and the letters are often quite illegible.

Where the assistance of A is not available, the ‘Palatine'
text is the best. Of the MSS. BCD the best is B. C and D are
copied from a single MS. and often reproduce its errors of
omission, substitution and so on. B is a more faithful copy of
the original and often serves to correct these errors. Where B
disagrees with CD, we can generally assure ourselves that the
reading of B was the reading of the common original, that the
reading of CD is a corruption due to the writer of the MS. of
which C and D are immediate copies. But where B agrees with
CD, the reading must be the reading of their common original.

Classical Review, June 1897.

' 11. The Prologue. It may be convenient to say something,
beyond what has been said p. xxv, about the Plautine Prologues
here. The Prologue is defined byAristotle (Poet. 12) as all that
precedes the first Choral Ode. In the Old Comedy anything
the author wished to say directly to the audience was said, not
at the beginning but in the middle of the play, by the παράβασις.

ln Tragedy, Euripides is the great employer of the Prologue
His habit is severely criticised by Aristophanes in the Ranae
v. 1200 ff. To Comedy the Prologue was more appropriate, and
was common in the plays of the Middle and New Comedy.
Following the practice of Menander and his contemporaries„
Plautus when he wrote a Prologue usually assigned it to some
one outside the regular dramatis personae. Thus in the
