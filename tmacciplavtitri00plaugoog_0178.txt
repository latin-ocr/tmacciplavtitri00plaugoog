not quite agree.⁹ Nescio quid to be taken together as one word ‘je ne
sais quoi! Nescr'oquis scans as a choriambus, nescio as a principal verb
is a cretio, eg. vv. 849, 9⁶0. .

celeri manu, a breach of Athenian propriety. Citiaeos walked ata
staid pace, only slaves should run. Cf. Poen. 5²2 liberos laurinus per
