the future of probability, ‘you will find that that is the man‚’ is highly
ludicrous here. In his relief that the name has been discovered the
Sycophant reveals his ignorance of the man himself. For this use

“a short while ago,’ see v. 608· Charmides has not told him so, but
is that a sufficient reason for marking a gap? Charmides is enjoying
his confusion, and the more inconsisteucies he can convict the Sycophant

Charmides was in Seleucia, now he is at Rhadamas. It is impossible
to fix the locality. The Sycophant may either mean that they travelled
homewards thus far together, or more probably he is purposely made to
contradict himself, as the whole of his pretended narrative is a tissue of
absurdities.

(B adihadamante) in Cecropia insula. It is better to cut out imula as
a gloss than to assume a short form Rhadamam, reading ad Rhadamant
in Cercopum insula. The Κέρκωπες figure in Greek mythology, as in
the story of Hercules. They are described as cunning thieves, and
appear as such in Attic Comedy. There were several plays called
