⁸10. toturn reddam nasamonitis, ‘Ill do the job and iool him
utterly! Nugacrisume=cum nraxinrr's augr's. Actum reddam like red·
dere transacturapofectum, ecfertum, inuentum, inpetratum δια, and the
same construction with dare andsacere. Exeunt, Callicles to his house,
Megaronides to the Forum.

Aer IV. (Sao-1114). Callicles’ position has been made much more
difficolt hythe proposal for his ward's hand, and the question how to
provide a dowry for her without revealing the existence of the treasure—
first complication. To obviate this difficulty a Sycophant is hired to
say that he comes from Charmides with letters and money. But
Charmides returns unexpectedly at this moment, and encounters the
Sycophant‚ who does not know him, outside his own house, when
aludicrous scene takes place. Thus the mission ol the Sycophant
makes things worse—second complication. Even Charmides is now
uncasy about the action of CallicleS, and his suspicions are pointed by
a chance meeting with Stasimus. Only at the end ol the Act does he
see Callicles and the disentanglement (euolutr'o) begin.

Sennis 1 (Bao-842). Charmides returns from abroad hythe entrance
from the harbour (lest). He is dressed in travelling costuma (χλαμὺς
and πέτασος) and returns thanks to Neptune lor his sasety. These

thanksgivings on saie return are a burlesque oi the tragic use. Compare
with this the thanksgivings Capt. 922, Mil. 411, Most. 431, Pers. 753,
Rud. 906, Stich. 402.

Metre: Anapaestic Tetrameters-the last four hall-lines Anapaestic ’
Dimeters.

820. malmintun el nannetensi, ‘to Neptune mighty lord ol the
salt sea? Buecheler followed by Leo changes multiootenti to arulsr'·
potenti (cl. Rud. 588, Pseud. 739). This is tempting, but as Plautus
uses the word multipotens elsewhere, eg. Bacch. 652, the change isat
least not necessary. Cf. uinpatens Pers. 252, caelipotens Pers. 755.

utnon. Scaliger's correction of et Nerei. Iuppiter aetherius:
Homer’s zen αἰθέρι ναίων.

⁸21. laetus lubens laudae ago al mus, ‘joyous and joyiul l
render praises and thanks) The pleonastic redundance is meant to
express the heartiness ol Charmides' thankfulness, for which no words
are sufficient. Laetus labens, asyndeton as vv. 243, 302, and there is also
triple atliteration with l and double with g· Grates, commonly ol thanks
to the gods, gratias to men. cf. Mil. 411 Ephesiae Dianae lacta laudes

gratesque agam.
