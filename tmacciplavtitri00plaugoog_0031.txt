Less common instances of the original shorter form are
postus (positus), poplus (populus), manuplares (manipulares).

Verbs which shew an omission of the root vowel are surgo,
pergo (purgo) and surpio for surripio.

With adjectives ending in ·er Plautus more usually writes the
longer form-dextera is more usual than dextra. But he often
has dextrouorsum, and apparently altra, altrum, for altera,
alterum.

The short form is very common in and per. sing. os so·called
pers, and in so·called pers. inf, eg. dixti, duxti, uinxti, pinxti,
uexti, misti, scripsti, accepsti‚ dixe, duxe‚ uexe, spexe, traxe,
intellexe, &c Dixisti, duxisti, &c are of later origin.

b. meus, tuds, suos (not tuus, suus), deus are scanned as
monosyllables. So quoius, quoi, huius, huic, rei, dies, diu, fui,
trium, duas, ais, ain, ait, eo, eam, eas, eat, eant, &c ··

The trisyllabic forms of meus, tuos, suos, deus, &c are

dissyllabic. So duorum, duellum, suisti, fuisse, puella, diebus,
&c Diutius and exeundum are trisyllabic.

The vowels are regularly run together in proin, proinde,
dein, deinde, dehinc, deerrare, dehortari, deosculari, and deesse

To the same principle we may assign a number of shortened
case-forms, is sor iis, isdem for iisdem, and verb-forms exit, redit
(peri), albam, aibas, and so on.

6. Hiatus. The general attitude of Latin to hiatus is given
by Cicero Orat. 150, ‘Quod quidem Latina lingua sic observat,
nemo ut tam rusticus sit, qui uocales nolit coniungere! Greek
allowed hiatus, but ‘nobis, ne si cupiamus quidem, distrahere¹
uoces conceditur? T hen, after quoting examples of hiatus from
Naeuius and Ennius, he concludes ‘hoc idem nostri saepius non
tulissent’ Quintilian also (1x. 4. 33) disapproves ‘uocalium
concursum, quod cum accidit, hiat et intersistit² et quasi laborat
oratio!

ln Plautus, as his text has reached us, hiatus occurs between
two words closely connected-a preposition and its noun, ‘a pair

⁴¹ distrahere=to leave an hiatus )( contrahere.
¹ intersistit=comes to a standstill.
