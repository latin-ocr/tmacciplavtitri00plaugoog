1011, 1011, The two lines are bracketed by Bergk. Theyseemto
be introduced as an expansion and explanation of r. ¹05²·

mage for magis like pote, potis, v. 352, ‘if you begin to prees harder
for payment.’ Magis, whichis the adv. corresponding to the compar.
mazar, is properly *mamis and takes its g from augrus, as figura
(sshura) from fingo. The suffix -e's is a weak grade of the compar.
suffix -a’as, but this -is was confused by the Romans with the nom. sing.
of facilis, petis δια, so that from magis, regarded as nom. sing. m. aod
f.. was formed a neuter mage, as pote from potis. By a similar confusion
satia a noun meaning ‘sufficiency,' developed a neuter *sata curtailed
to sat. Lindsay‚ L. L. p. 588.

1⁰65. meur eet marottam ttadmue aeram. Charmides coming
nearer, or looking at him more closely, recogoises the speaker as his own
slave.

tote. talentum This is the same piece of ‘bounce' as he uttered
r. 727. A talent would be au enormous sum for a slave to have to lend,
and Stasimus talks about the transactiou in quite a cool way asif
he often did the like. Vv. 1053, 1054, if they are allowed to stand, very
greatly impair the force of this sentence. '

luet. tnetptenttortzc„ v. 93⁶·

rebus eurem pannem, ‘meddle with affairs of state’ Cura in old
Latin takes the dat, like conserto rei alicui, as often as the aec„ Rud.
146 tritico curat Ceres, Truc. 137 tua uestimento et cito attenuabat curas.

1018. pottue qnam, tu quaa proxumum, meo tergo tutelam
terem, ‘rather than, the point that touches me most closely, take care
of my back! Tutelam gerere as v. 870, i.e. save it from a thrashing‚
v. 1009.

1019. On hearing Stasimus' intention of returning home, Charmidea
comes forward and calls to him. Leo divides the words differently.
(ΣΗ Heus tu, asta itaer, audi. ST. heus tu, nan sto, where Stasimus’
heus tu is a mocking echo of Charmides’.

aeta fllao, vv. 608 and 627: te uolo, r. 516, ‘Iwant you.¹ But
Stasimus replies‚ ‘What if Ι don't want you to want met'

toto. nimium multer, sc. dr‘cis or agir. Saeuiter is one of the
many second declension adverbs formed with -ter. Plautus is fond ol
these forms in -ter and uses them alongside of the forms in -e. Thus
saeue and saeuiter, auare and auariter, blande and blanditer, firme and

firmiter&c. Saeuiter, Pseud. 1290, Poen. 335.

10⁶1. emere melluet quoi moeres, ‘you'd better buy some one to*

order about,’ i.e. l’m not your slaue, don‘t order me. Stasmusnasnot
