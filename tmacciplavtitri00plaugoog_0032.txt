INTRODUCTIOM xxiii

of nouns, a noun and its verb, an adjective and its noun, &c., de
ea, octo hominum, gratiam habeo, tuam amicam, eri imperia.

But hiatus is practically confined to cases when there is a
pause in metre or in sense which at least tones down the harshness.
Thus there may be hiatus at the caesura. Most frequently where
hiatus occurs there is a pause in both sense and metre, and, even
where these double pauses coincide, in an overwhelming number
of cases there is no hiatus, eg. when one speaker leaves a line
unfinished and another takes it up hiatus is rare.

Hiatus most frequently accompanies breaks in sense when
they are considerable, especially if there is a change of speakers.

Most frequently hiatus is met with in the case of mono-
syllables with a long vowel (pro, de, dcc.) ora short vowel if the
word ends with m (nam, cum) in cases like quae ego, qui in,
nam ego, ne ego, qui homo, di ament, cum Alcumena, quam ob
rem, qui obuiam.

Cases of hiatus are pretty frequent before homo, in nom.
gen. dat. acc, flagitium hominis, quoi homini, esse hominem.
Bergk and Corssen in these cases would write homonis, homoni,
homonem.

There is a similar hiatus before habea, gratiam habeo; hic,
tu hunc, tu hoc, quoi haec, qua huc, and other words beginning
with h.

As might be expected hiatus is allowed in interjections,
especially after the monosyllables o, au, ah, eu, heu, em—and
with vocatives.

Generally it may be laid down that hiatus is permitted
(1) after monosyllables, (2) after dissyllables which scan as
pyrrhics whether the last syllable is naturally short or shortened,
(3) after words of more than two syllables ‘perrarum esse hiatum
nec sine excusatione ferendum‘ (Ussing, p. ²24 q.v.).

lt will be understood that the lines are quite distinct one
from another, and that a vowel at the end of one verse followed
by another at the beginning of the next does not make an
hiatus.
