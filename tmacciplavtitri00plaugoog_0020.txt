aud Scipiones—with such repeated and violent invective that
he was imprisoned and was in confinement when Plautus wrote
the Miles gloriosus vv. 212 ff. (about 210 nu). He was freed by
the tribuni plebis, but was banished and died at Utica 199 ue.
The well-known epitaph written by Naeuius for himself in
Satumians shews bis Campana superbiit. His Punic War is
compared by Cicero (Brut 75) to the work of the statuary
llyron His dramatic works, of which some fragments survive,
were mainly comic-not tragic.
2. Plautus. His great successor Titus Maccius Plautus
=(T· Maccius, not M. Accius, was proved to be his name by
Ritschl from the Ambrosian MS.) devoted his entire attention
ζ lo Comedy. Of Plautus’ life but little is known. He was born
-at Sarsina-now Sassina-a municipium in Umbria, and so
¹lile most great Roman writers, Cicero, Vergil, Horace, Livy,
Tacitus, Catullus, Propertius, Terence, Pliny, Martial, δια,
was a provincial by birth. He came to Rome as a boy, was
known there as Plautus, a name according to Festus (p. 239 M.)
derived from a peculiarity of the feet, as the Umbrians called
atat-tooted man Plotus or Plautus. Thos Plautus is one of
the many nick-names that became hereditary cognomina, as
Scaeuola, Cursor, &c He found employment as an assistant to
the stage-carpenters and scene-painters1 (artffices scenica), made
Some money, which he lost in foreign trade, returned poor to
Rome and hired himself to a miller (pistor), and in this position
wrote his first three pieces for the stage. If we allow time for
these experiences we cannot make him less than 30 when he
began to write. As further he was a contemporary, like Naeuius,
of the two Scipios, and is 'regularly coupled with them and
Naeuius, we must assume that he began to write a good many
years before their death 212. We may then place the beginning
of his literary activity about 224 and his birth not later than
²54 nc. This will agree with the data we get from Cicero, viz.
hat he had already written many pieces in 197 (Cic. Brut. 72),

¹ This is the common view. But F. Leo (Plautinische Forschungen,
v. 65) is probably right in arguing that Plautus was not a stage:
ssistant but an actor.
