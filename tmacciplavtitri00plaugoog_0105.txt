Prologus. It has been pointed out in the Introduction that the
Prologue is outside the play proper, and is usually delivered by a young
actor in a special dress (matus prologi), that most of the Prologues we
possess are post-Plautiae, but that this Prologue to the T rinummus is, Ι
at least as a whole, from the hand of Plautus himself.

This is one of the cases where the Prologue is delivered by some l
allegorica] person who does not appear in the action of the play. Thus
we have Arcturus in the Prologue of the Rudens, Auxilium in the
Cistellaria, and Lar Familiaris in the Aulularia. The only differenee ‘in
this case is that there are two allegorical persons, Luxuria and her
daughter Inopia, but as Inopia speaks only a single line and then enters
the house, the departure from the usual practiceis not great. Such use
of allegorical persons in Prologues was common in Menander, and was
taken by him from the tragic stage. Thus compare with this scene the
similarscene in the sphere of Tragedy, viz. Eur, Herc· Fur„ where
Iris sends Lyssa (Madness) into the house of Heracles.

The difficulties and peculiarities of this Prologue are excellentlydis·
eussed by Trautwein‚ pp. 23-32.

The curtain is lowered. On the stage in front of the houses are seen
Luxuria and her daughter Impia, who is sent into the house occupied
by Lesbonicus to do her work. , -

1. mamis. The rule by which these deponent verbs are regu·
larly followed by the abl. (instr.) is not yet fixed in Plautus’ time. eff
takes generally the abl, but sometimes the aaa, at least where the
object is neuter, abuti the acc, frui once in Plautus with abl, in
Terence four times with abl, once with acc, potiri in Plautus twice
with gen, twice with ace, twice with abl. Fungar iu both Plautus and
Terence regularly takes the acc. Plautus has this phrase naunus fungi
six times, Terence has officium fisngi five times, and afficio stengi only
once.

2. naam fore quem diuum, a popular and colloquial expression

mstead of qus'fims futurus sit, common in Plautus with duae, pade.
‘01¹6 arbt'lrarc' and cludere.
