xxviii INTRODUCTION.

political. Its end was political satire. Such comedy could
exist only under democracy. lt rose with the democracy and
it fell with 'the democracy. Even while it flourished Crates
wrote plays more analogous to the original (Sicilian) type But
the decay of the Old Comedy was no sudden thing. We may
trace the process of disintegration in the later plays of Aristo
phanes himself. Thus in the Plutus, which, as it stands, is a
play ol the Middle Comedy, there is no Parabasis, and the
Chorus is magni nominis umbra. When we hear further that
it became very difficult to get people to undertake the large
expenses the Chorus entailed, it is evident that its complete
disappearance was only a question of time.

Hence in the N ew Comedy we expect to find neither (1) poli·
tical satire, nor (2) a Chorus. The New Comedy is almost
wholly social—it is the comedy os life and manners, in the sense
in which we now understand the word. And these are the
topics upon which Roman Comedy was based

terior-a street with houses at the back and a narrow lane
(angiportum) between them. The frontage of the stage was
great-some authorities say 180 leet Hence the scenes (eg.
the opening os the Epidicus) where slaves huny across the
stage, for owing to its length the audience could keep them
in sight for some time. The doors of the buildings at the back
opened outwards on to the stage. A character coming out often

exterior, no interior is shewn. All meetings and conversations ¹
*must take place in the street. The Greek Orchestra has dis-
appeared and the space thus made vacant is filled with the
best seats.

The Chorus of the Old Greek Comedy has also disappeared,
and thus the lyric clement proper is lost. The Chorus was
the bond os union in the ancient drama, the basis of its structure
as an altemation os odes and episodes. But New Comedy and

Roman Comedy consisted of a series os scenes, which rapidly
