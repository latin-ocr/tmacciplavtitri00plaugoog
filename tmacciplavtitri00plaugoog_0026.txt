adegree of correctness which shame separated syllables aud
assigned them their unvarying metrica} length and value But
with the' lambic and the Trochee of dramatic poetry the case
ras different, not only with Plautus, but with Ennius himself,
Terence, Accius and Pacuvius. Catullus and Horace first ap
plied to the Iambic metre the Greek rule strictly observed in
¹ theHexameter.

The Plautine measurement of syllables thus naturally corre·
sponds to the looseness of popular usage The sharp rules
lor lengthening by position and fixed length had not yet been
introduced. But it is by no means always possible to explain
inal cases the popular usage followed. Thus ferentarius, seden-
tatius are scanned with the second syllable short. Probably this
is because the n was scarcely sounded, but it may have been
theta syllable was slurred.

Cicero, Orat. 161, discusses the weak sound of final s, and
quotes instances from Lucilius, &c.‚ to shew how it was neglected.
Only poetae noui found it a stumblingblock. He himself pro·

in the oth foot of the Senarius, which is always a pure iambus,

,ι and at the close of an iambic Tetrameter acatalectic (=not a

· syllable short, i.e. with 8 feet), and trochaic Tetrameter catalectic
l=a syllable short, ie. with γὲ feet), s is not counted. Hence
Such terminations as commonitus sum, saluds sis, estls nunc,

Similarly a mute beforea liquid does not affect the length

gf the syllable, so that agros, libros, duplex, dcc. are not spondees
mmm

We may note the following general principles of Plautine
prosody.

Α Shortening of long syllables.

The most noteworthy cases are those in which words which
we should naturally scan as iambi (ὴ) become pyrrhic (v v).
When the accent or emphasis of pronunciation falls upon the
short first syllable, the second syllable instead of being long is
