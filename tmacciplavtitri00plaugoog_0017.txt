viii PREFA CE.

throughout and adopted as the standard of reference; the
short notes embodied in his apparatus criticus are almost
invariably convincing and luminous. To these books, and
especially to Brix,I desire to acknowledge my obligations
fully here, because in the Notes names have not been
mentioned where the mention could be avoided. The
references to standard works will shew sufficiently my
obligations to them: 1 am specially indebted to Mr W. M.
Lindsay's Latin Language (Oxford 1894), to which I have
referred continually as it is an indispensable book which
every classical student may be expected to possess, and to
P. Langen’s admirable Beitriige zur Kritik und Erkliirung
des Plautus (Leipzig 1880).

The work of preparing the edition has deepened my
convictions on two points. First that, although so much
good work has been done upon the play, it is by no means
easy, that there are passages on which clearer light is still to
seek, certainly that there are problems which I should
be sorry to profess to solve. And secondly that the
Trinummus is indeed an admirable play, free from all
grossness and fit for anyone's perusal, artistic in its con-
ception and careful in its execution. It seems to me very
hazardous to place any even of the great plays of Plautus
before it in point of interest or men't, and none I think
better repays a careful reading.

But the greater the play, the more inadequate my
edition is likely to be. I can only say that I shall be
grateful to anyone who will help me to remove the errors of
many kinds which I can hardly hope to liave avoided.
