INTRODUCTIOM xiii

ididnot last long, and was incapable of reproduction save in a
idemocracy like the Athenian. The New Comedy from its
i sinplicity, its interest depending on character-sketching, exciting
*situations and developments, was specially suitable sor trans·
s, plantation from Athens to Rome. The brilliant period os the
' New Comedy at Athens was the half-century that followed the
’ death os Alexander the Great, its great lights were Menander,
{Phaenea Diphilus. As we have seen, Liuius Andronicus
ἶ introduced this Comedy at Rome first 240 tte, was followed by
⁵ Naeuius who like him wrote Tragedies also; then carne Plautus,
Caecilius, and Terentius who exclusively devoted themselves to
yconoedia palliata. ln fruitfulness os productiori, independent
, use oi his Greek originals, power of language, lively delineation
ἱ oi character, readiness and wit, Plautus stands first of all the
ff Roman comedians1.
ξ Gellius (111. 3) states that r 30 pieces passed under Plautus’
j natne. Seruius says in the introduction to his Commentary on
the Aeneid-‘ Plautus is said by some to have written 21 plays,
by others 40, by others 1003 The large numbers in these
estinates no doubt include some early plays by unknown authors
under the name of Plautus. Varro, who first treated the subject
in anything os a critical spirit, enumerares 21 plays as ascribed
10 Plautus in all the lists (indices), all of which we possess except
the Vidularia, which was lost between the 6th and 11th centuries
AB· These are the Fabulae Varronianae. ln a second class
Varro places the plays which were set down to Plautus in most
οἱ the lists. This class probably included 19, which with the
21undoubted comedies would give the 4ο of Seruius' second
estimate. Outside the 21 undisputed plays we know the titles
only of 32. The extant plays are given in the ordinary MSS. in
the following order: Amphitruo, Asinaria, Aulularia, Captiui,
Curculio, Casina, Cistellaria, Epidicus, Bacchides, Mostellaria,

Menaechmi, Miles Gloriosus, Mercator, Pseudolus, Poenulus,
Persa, Rudens, Stichus, Trinummus, Truculentus. This order

's alphabetical but takes account only os the initial letter
n the titles; the one case where the initial letter is neglected
