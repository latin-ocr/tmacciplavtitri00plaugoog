unctum, ‘empty,' 'diseugaged‚' the archaic form of the later sensas
used by Plautus. Cf. Pseud. 4⁶9 sac se's uotiuas aedis aurium mars
for uacatio, notare for natare in vulgar Latin, and Cas. 527, where
Plautus puns on uocare and uacare. See Munro’s note on Lucr.1.

qul is the old abl. (instr.) of the relative, the interrogative, and the
indefinite pronoun, used of all genders (eg. it is fem. in v. 15), and

the point of view which is at the base of each individual sentence. Se
