bonicus’ part against the award of Stasimus hasbeen contined to look
or gesture, and the simple verb tueris is not very probable3 contuor,
tutuor, obtuse are the eompounds in use. Niemeyer suggests ted auri

reading, I propose te iuris multabo essina, ‘I will fine you the legal

reject vv, 707, 708, but objection to them vanishes ii the allusion is to
some Greek system of fining bad actors. Roman actors were not fined
till a later period (Tac. A. 1. 17). In Plautus' time. as slaves, they were
beaten if they acted badly, see v. 990 and the close of the Cistellaria, v.
784, ornamenta ponent (‘tal‹e off their costumes'). postidea leci, qui

Lesbonicus is angry at the intervention os Stasimus, all the more so as
he has gone against his master. So be testily asks him ‘what business
he has to interieret' By quid Lesbonicus means cur. Eut the imper·
turbable Stasimus answers as if he had meant quo uude. Perhaps we
may say, ‘how came you to interfere’ dcc.

Quid att interpellatio est? is well-known Plautine idiom by which,

wanted to know horu, not why, he interiered, Stasimus pertly answers,

became Stasimus withdraws a few steps as he speaks. Eodem paeto
