³0. t] NOTES. 91

nuri is used for ‘jewellery’ generally. ssubessllm, carrying the
‘eunock's leathers, which were used as sans-sandaliam, because
nudus were taken off when the guests took their places at table, and
›rought by a slave just before they took their departure. Hence soleas
l(escere &c as Hor. Sat. 11. 8. 77=‘t0 prepare to get up and go.'

2³8· confflem, probably to sing during the meal: mumulus!-
the cistellae contained money and valuables Girls with cistellae are
'ely common on painted vases. The plurals are plurals of rhetorical
&aggeratim to make the whole number appear as large as possible,
md with the same object the ‘messengers' are comically subdivided

into nausii, renuntil, as if there was one set to bear messages and
¹mother set to carry replies.

m renum pann et peni, ‘plunderers ol prog and provender,’
in apposition to the slaves described in the two preceding lines, to
whom also illis v. 255 a refers.

tol. ubl qul sest, quam prou stt perui, ‘oi how little account a
man is when he is poor‚' qui is indefinite and ubl qui=si quis. Cf.
Pers. 313 nam abi qul male tangil manu, dolerescooriuntur, Pseud. 681
lette ubi quoi scimus consilium accedun, hominem calum eum esse
declararem. Pretl, by the shortening to which words properly iambic
uere subject, known as ‘the breuis breulenr’ law.

26⁸· amois the Greek imper. ἄπαγε. In Latin it is really an
exclamation used either absolutely or, as here, with an acc„ apage te,

‘avaunt thee,‘ which is an acc. oi exclamation, like the accs. alter alr,
herc dc.
tta. lund, like ἐκεῖνο, os something that is to follow, here the infini-
lires esse (=edere) et bibere. ‘Although this e's pleasant, Ι mean seasting
lud drinking, still Love brings bitterness enough to vex (the lover).’
‘later amara are brought together for the assonance. So Vergil plays on
ibe sound,Ecl.111. 110. ef. Cist. 68 eleo an artare occipere amarum
ull ibid. 69 Amor et melle et selle erl fecundusimus, gustui dat dulce,
mrum ad satietatem usque oggerit.
nub. satis qnod aegra ut We seem to want, as Leo says, satis
ruod <ummah aegre sil. The lover is the subject to the verbs in the
hlowing lines, and that he should be mentioned here seems indispens-
lble. Otherwise the change ol subject from amor to amator is a harsh
ml σύνεσιν construction.

tlt. mmor ior Μαί, Spengel. Cf. Poen. 508 alque equidm
lacte dedrla opera amicos fugitaui senes, and with the whole passage
Troc574 (mererere ereum erum) prehendit bonu, luce, honoremque coticis.
