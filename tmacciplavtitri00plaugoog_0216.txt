know‚' illum by attraction to the caseos quem, as often happens when the
demonstrative is first, and its verb does not come till after the relative
sentence. See on v. 137, and add Amph. 1009 Naucratem quem con-
. uenire ualui, in naui non erat, Bacch. 4²0 scd tu qui pro tam cormpto
dicis causam filio, eademne erat haec disciplina tibi? The speaker places
a the name or pronoun emphatically first, and, as it were, without deter-
’ mining belorehand the structure ol the whole sentence, attaches it to the
nearest verb, which is that ol the relative sentence.
¹ 999. eho‚cuaeaoan. See on v. 55.

987. ain tu tandem? ‘do you really mean it?’ Ain (aisne), ain
tu, ain uero, ain tandem, ain tu tanedem, always at the beginning ol a
speech, either interrupting another speaker, or expressing surprise
and astonishment at what the other speaker has said. See Langen,

’ Beitr'agep. 119.

999. inducamus, ‘his veriest sels,’ ipsehas failed to carry conviction,
a stronger word is wanted, and so the comic superlative insumatur is
coined, like αὐτότατος, Ar. Plut. 83. The form {asima or ipsuma seems
to have been actually used colloquially in the Imperial period, as
Petronius, 69 p. 46. 16 Β, 75 p. 51. ²3 Β. See on v. 397.

989. enimuero cerlo, ‘truly indeed, in sober earnest.' The three
words are found in combination Poen. 435, and in Amph. 964 an id
εὀτα danti? equidem serio oc uero ratus, sm'o is the antithesis ol ioca
This is its lorce here. ‘Now that I am convinced you are Char-
mides in all sober seriousness, seeing that you are back home again '-
then after professing to speak serio he continues rbco with a παρὰ

, προσδοκίαν ending.

999. mpuanls meo umbrata ot nouorum udfflum, ‘you shall be
flogged at the discretion oi mysell and the new aediles) Alter quoniam
Maenia we expect a promise ol the cena aduenticia or umato with which
a sale arrival was always celebrated, as Bacch. ‘94 and 537, Epid. 7,
Stich. 471, Truc. 127, and Cure. 562, where the promise ola dinner
takes an unexpected turn. But παρὰ προσδοκίαν, the promise ol a dinner

' isreplaced by the promise ol afloggiug. The Sycophant treats Char·

3 mides as a slave who has acted badly, and is tobeflogged lor it. See

! v. 708. He coolly associates himself with the aediles in determining

l the amount ol the punishment. ‘l’he line is important as shewing that
the play was probably acted at the Megalensia. and could not have been
earlier than the year 194 nc. See Introduction, p. xxxv.

999. unsarananeanocu Moenoenum palae. Asecond
time the Sycophant begins as il he were going to offer congratulations
