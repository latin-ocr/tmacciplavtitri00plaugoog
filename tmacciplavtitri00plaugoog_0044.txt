INTRODUCTION. xxxv

011 the 15th oi March. The aediles are here spoken ol as still
‘new,' they have recently entered upon their duties, so we must
look for a festival which comes not long after the Ides of March.

This shews that the play was produced at the ludi Megalenses
or Megalensia which took place in April, for the ludi Romani
were in Sept. and the ludi plebei in N ov.

The Megalensia became scenic in the year 194 ac. Hence
the play could not have been earlier than that year.

v. 542 tum autem Syrorum, genus quod patrentr‘ssimumst
hominum dre.

Syrian slaves may no doubt have been known in Rome
before the war with Antiochus 191 B.c.‚ but probably did not
appear in any great numbers until the close of the war.

v. 545 the allusion to the supplicium ol the Campanians,
the mention of gold Philippics v. 152, the complaint ol moral
corruption, seli-secking and greed vv. 2811, 283 ft, 1028 ff. all
point to 190 nc. as the earliest year possible for the first
production of the play.

Thns we infer that the T rinummus belongs to the last
period of Plautus' activity, and is one os his latest plays.

lt will be remembered that there was at this tirne no per·
manent theatre at Rome. Wooden theatres with rows of seats
were built regularly each year after 145 Β. c. ; the first stone thea-
tre was the Theatrum Magni completed by Pompey 54 nc. ln
the time of Plautus and Terence scenic displays took place near
the temple of the god in whose honour the festival was held.
A temporary wooden stage was put up, and the audience stood

ι unless they chose to have their own seats brought for them.

One play only was presented on each day. The performance
commenced about neon, and ended in tirne for the spectators to
return home for dinner.

(3) 'The Text of the T rinummus.

Part of the T rinummus is contained in the great Ambrosian

r Palimpsest A. The verses which it exhibits are 1-96, 17 3-569‚
. 637-673‚ 738—774, 836-863, and 1045-1078‚ i.e. a little more
theubalf the play.
3 On the whole the text of lew plays is in a better condition.
