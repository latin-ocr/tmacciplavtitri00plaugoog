¹ suli] NOTES. 67

' you vill not take me in the least bit,’ i.e. I shall not get the worst
· ofthe bargain. tantillum δεικτικῶς, ‘not even so little! Cf. v. 483.
uerborum, part. gen. after tantillum, and dare alicui uerba is a regular
phrase=to deceive, to cheat. Dederis here and obrepseris v. 61 are fut.
peris in the idiomatis sense ‘you will find that you have,’ ‘the result
will shew that you have’ Cf. Aul. 578 ego saxo et operam et mnam
Memmi simul. See Roby, L. G. 1604. faxo is properly a sigmatic
. urin form. The sigmatie aorist had in Latin a subjunctive in ·o,
, faxo, i.e. sac-so, dim (dic-so), ero (stro), and an optative in -im, dixin,
i sannanim, annm &a for older dic-siem, like sim for siene. These
forus are used for the fut. perf. and the perf. subj. respectively. Thus
ι fitto=fnero and faxim = fecerim. See Lindsay, L. L. p. 4⁶5· Faxo is
² most osten paratactia i.e. it is only formally juxtaposed with tlre verb
used with it. According to Sonuenscheiu (on Rud. 365) with faxo the
bt indie. is found'fifty times in the uss, of Plautus, the pres. subj.
arten times. Both these constructions faxo scz'es and faxo scias are
munnio, the hypotactic construction faxo nt scias in Asin. 897 is quite
β neptium! in Plautus.
fi. nmque enlm tu, nodo. So the uss, but Ritschl nempe,
i Geppert nanctum enim te credis &a But nonaque enim is right.
Plautus uses nonaque in the place of nam before a vowel: thus always
i namque edepol, but nom...edepol when another word lilre tu intervenes.
Namque introduces an easily supplied ellipse when itis followed by an
thmative particle like enim-here scanned as if fni through the slurriug
·of final m. Enim is an affirmative particle in at enim, qnia enim, nir
ean, non enim, nnnc enim, certe enim, immo enim, uerum eninr and
,θείω uero. See Langen’s discussion, Beitr'age, p. 262 ff, where he
&stains that this is the exclusive force of the word in Plautus.
fficfly, in old Latin enim is merely an asseverative particle—cf.
Quicni enimuero-in Plautus it asserts and strengthens, meaning ‘in-
deed' probably never isa purely causei, ‘fon' but in Terence it begins
‘tamn ‘fon'
· mdo isinserted perenthetically and is generally ironical, ‘I suppose,’
'ndoubt’
ne inprudentem sumpseris, ‘(you will not get the worst of the
ἠὼ) for you no doubt will be found to have stolen a march
ph tue unawares.' ‘llou are a likely fellow to get round a simpleton
:like me,’ ironically. Obrepere soll. by acc, though the dat. is the
÷dassioal construction, just as occursare takes the acc, Mil. που( nam
gfta me occursant mullae.
