181. qnia opus 111 iacto ‘tell him to consider what must be done
about the dowry.' This is the regular construction, viz. the part. in the
abl. with quid or other neut. pron. (id, quod, &c.). The part. is instru-
mental abl. aster opus (or mm), and quidis either acc. or, perhaps more

adj. Τὴε person concerned‚ if expressed‚ is in the dat. (3111817.

111. neque enlm 1111 damno umquem esse 7111111. The sentence
is interrupted by Stasimus’ abi audo. Meam negligentiam is acc. before

darum esse. Damno is predicatire dat„ as it is Asin. 571,ι Bacch. 1103,

ment translate ‘I will assuredly never allow my sister to suffer...fr0n

117. neque enlm. Here again the sequence ol the sentence is
broken by Stasimus with his impatient I mado. llsequeenim...apsit is one
sentence twice thus interrupted. ‘Nor assuredly...does it seem fair that
