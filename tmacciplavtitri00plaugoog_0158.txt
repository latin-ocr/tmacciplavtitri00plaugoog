Se. 1v.] NOTES. 111

Latin form, is τραπεζίτης. Through Aeone, which had a tendency to
tumst back r after the vowel (βράδιστος, βάρδιστος, bardus, κρίνω enno,
κροκόδειλος corcodilus 810), the word passed through lower-Italy into
latin Z was brought into use at Rome in the transcription of Greek
words only at the close of the Republic. Previously s had been used,
single s at the beginning, ss in the middle 01 1 word. Thus sono: ζώνη,
πεαεεαεμᾶζα,1αιίίε1οτβαδὶζω, patrisso:rr'urptsu¹ For the history of
the souud see Lindsay‚ L. L. p. 104. The true Latin for ‘banker’ is
numerius.

mille is by Plautus regularly treated as a noun‚=yeheds, and so
followed by the gen.. ‘a thousand 01 drachmae.¹ So mille nummum.
¹ a thousand of pieces,' vv. 954, 959. 966, 970, 1139. For the ‘inserted'
vowel in drochuma beside the Greek δραχμή (onaptyxis or suarobleaktrh
see Introd. p. xxi.

428. dehtbula‘tt The compounds of habeo are always scanned in
Plautus asif they were written in the contracted form. Here debibuisti is
scanned debuisti, cohibeo may always be scanned as if written eo’beo, and
prohibeo as if probeo. On the other hand praebeo is sometimes written
proedibeo, but the scansion is apparently always trisyllabic. See
Lindsay, L. L. p. ¹43·

1111. spopondi...dependl‚ ‘Yon mean the thousand for which I
stood bail ' (adrepe, as v. ι118), ‘Nay‚ say “for which I stood paymeut.”
If you had only gone hail it would not have mattered‚ but you had to
pay: therefore your statement needs correction' Plautus uses pendere
in the sense ‘pay‚' but not elsewhere dependere. But Cicero in his
Letters uses spendm and dependere together just as they are used here,
eg. Fam. 1. 9. 9 dependendum eibi est, quod mihi pro illo spppondisti.

1111. que 0001111010 pronuper tu emotus es. A gives this
‘nnplautine’ line before the preceding line. It might be licked into
shape bycorrecting ‘quia sponsionem propter tute exuetuses,’ ‘because on
account 01 your hail you yourself were forced to pay,’ ‘were dunned 101
payment‚’ applying exegor=stogitor to the person on whom the demand
is made. But the line is a versified gloss ou the previous line and, as it
spoils the connexion, should be bracketed. Pro illo adulescente 810.
follows immediately on v. 427, ‘Nay, say, “which I paid'' for the
youth, whom you declared to be wealthy‚' so that according to your
shewing you ran no risk of being called upon for the money.

4²⁹. - ut uuluam tuna perierit is dependent on sactum. Stasimus ·
takes up Lesbonicus' sactum. L. ‘That is true‚' or ‘That's a fact)
S. ‘lies 1 afact that thet money is gone! So Aul. 154, E. in rem hoe
