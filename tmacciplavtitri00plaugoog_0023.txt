xiv INTRODUCTION.

—the Bacchides-is to be explained by the fact that a
allusion in the Bacchides shews it to be a later play than tl
Epidicus, hence it is placed after the Epidicus in the list. Neot'
less to say these do not all possess the sarne merit, and are nt
to be ranked in the same class. Brix calls six (Aulularit
Captiui‚ Bacchides, Menaechmi, Pseudolus, Trinummus) liro

The text of all has not reached us quite complete. There ar

corruptions; others, Epidicus, Mercator, Persa, Stichus, ar

expresses himself unfavourably about Plautini numeri and sala

by the wide difference between the Prosody and Metre of th
two writers.

The originals of Plautus were the Attic writers of the Ne*
Comedy. The Trinummus was based upon the θησαυρός r
Philemon, the Mostellaria upon his Φάσμα. From the Ἐμπομ
of Philemon carne the Mercator, frorn his Κληροὺμενοι tl
Casina The Rudens is drawn from a play os Diphilus, tl
Asinaria frorn the 'ovaydr of Demophilus. From the great po·
of the New Comedy, Menander, come the Bacchides (Δ
