INTRODUCTION. xxv

bustle and haste are intended to be expressed. This is an
innovation, for Greek writers do not use these metres. The
diaeresis after the 4th foot is more often neglected in octonarii
than in septenarii. Trisyllabic feet are found in the 4th place,
the 8th foot is pure

When the excitement has passed the octonarii usually pass
into another and quieter mette, generally trochaic septenarii.

A system of octonarii is terminated by a clausula (short
verse) of kindred metre, ie an iambic system will finish with
iambi, a trochaic with trochees.

Similar short lines are sometimes prefixed to systems.

Trochaic octonarii are seldom long-continued.

Anapaests (generally acatalectic) are used by Plautus with
considerable licence. Thus a dactyl is followed by an anapaest,
and a proceleusmatic substituted for an anapaest. The ana-
paestic metre was difficult to observe accurately in Latin.

Other metres are Cretic [—--], Paeonic [-m or Μ-]
(a cretic is often substituted for a paeonic-a choriambus [-2 --]
is admitted), Bocchtbc, tetrameter and trimeter, and mixed
metres in Cantica, for which see the authorities given above.

Terence may have a more artistic mastery than Plautus of
the ordinary metre of the dialogue. He cannot approach him
in facility of adapting and varying his metres, ‘his numeri
innumeri, to the animated moods and lively fancies of his
characters’ ›(Sellar).

8. The Parts os a Roman Comedy, &c (a) The separate

’ parts of a Roman comedy are Prologus, Diuerbium, and
Canticum. The Prologue is defined by Aristotle (Poet. 12) to
be all that precedes the entrance of the Chorus. In Roman
Comedy a Prologue, where there was one, served two purposes:

l (1) it placed the audience in possession of the plot so far as was

,t necessary, told them the provenance of the play and so forth,

h' (2) it took the place to some extent of the παράβασις in the Old

5, Greek Comedy, and gave the poet an opportunity of expressing
his views to the audience and asking their favour. The

g Bacchides, Epidicus, Mostellaria, Persa, Stichus have no

rt Prologue, and the Prologues now prefixed to Plautine plays «
