⁵104. romscommrecurum...1nonxens, i.e. ne animum induxeris
me commissurum ut patiar id fieri. Ne animum abduxeris=m credi·
dene, so antheum aduerto=animaduerto, and κατὰ σύνεσιν is constructed
accordingly. For the emphatic position os id, see on v. ao.

τοῦ. non enimporsurnqnln exclamem...rdwr‚ ‘Ireally can’t help
shouting out, “bravo, bravo, Lysiteles, encore’'.’ Stasimus has been
listening all this time. He now shews himself. He is naturally most
anxious that Lesbonicus should not part with the land, sor, is the land
goes exile is assured for him. Stepping sorward, he compares the dis·
cussion between the two friends ‘to a dramatic contest (ἀγών) and,
constituting himself judge, awards the prize to Lysiteles and punish·
ment to Lesbonicus.

The passage raises the question whether there were poetical contests
and prices at Rome. Passages like the Prologues to the Amph. and‘
Poen- (Amph. 64 ff, Poen soff.) are slender evidence to go upon. On
the whole, Mommsen is quite justified in arguing that, from the silence
os Prolognes and Didascaliae, we must infer that there were no such
contests The allusion then belongs to the Greek original, and probably
had no counterpart at Rome. This view is strengthened by v. 708,
q. v.

nonenim, ‘really not,' ‘indeed not,’ enim is an asseverative particle
asin at enim (v. 919), quia eninr, nil enim, numquam enim, certe enim,
immo enim, mm enim, and enim uero (vv. 958, 987, 989). See on
v. 61.

non porcum quin. The impersonal non potest and potin ut: nonne
potis est ut, v. 628, are used without fieri, hence non possum (nequeo)
without facere. Euge? (εὖγε) and πάλιν and Martial’s sophdswodtir), like
most exclamations used at entertainments, are borrowed from Greek, just
as we borrow brana da capo, encore from Italian and French, and all
our musical terms irom Italian. On Greek ¹words in Plautus, see vv. 187.

¹8⁰6. bic ulctuct, ‘Lesbonicus is beaten ⁹-but in the next line ln'c
is Lysiteles In this line Lysiteles is directly addressed in the second
person, and the change is rather abrupt, but, as with hic...kic Stasimus
points to or touches the person meant, it would be clear enough on the
stage. ,
⁷0¹1. agit, the composer and the actor are identified. In the early

history of the Greek Drama the poet always played the leading part.
