ruc recen, quasi ri dre.

turbine· nonu. cf. Cure. 647 exoritur uentus turbo.

886. melum, note the quantity.

887. ruere, trans. ‘make fall! The word is transitive in poetry‚

‘participial¹ forms, Auctumnus, Vertumnus, alumnus, mmm, dam-
num irc.

The period is a long one. It begins with an ‘ii' clause, absque soret
te=si siue te foret, then follows the apodosis distraxisrent ἃς. The
reason ior the statement is given in ita &c (which might be replaced by
a nam clause). and ita isfollowed first by descriptive imperi, thenby
hist. infin. Finally, to couple the whole period more closely together,
the original protasis is repeated in a different and fuller form—ni tua
pax prusia soret praesto is absque soret te ‘vrit large! Cf. the period
Pers. 836-840.

888. opace v. 158, certumst v. 270. Dehinc monosyllabic by
synizesis, as always in Plautus. But the synizesis insilio otio and other
licenses ot this Canticum would not be permitted in ordinary lambio
or Trochaic lines.

phant coming from the Forum (right) into the street in iront ol his

as 1 do '-the two enter the space in iront nithe house together.

⁸41. dom1 cuplo=otrov ἐπιθυμῶ, cupio constructed like cupiens
rum, ‘I am desirous of! So Mil. 964 quae cupiunt tui.

The Sycophant does not see Charmides, who watches him, till v. 871.

Scene 2 (843—997). Enter the Sycophant‚ disguised es a
foreigner. Charmides watches the Sycophant, then v. 871 he shews

himself, draws from the fellow his absurd story, and finally reveels him·
seli. This is the most strictly comic scene in the play.
Metre: Septenarian Trochaics.
