888. anns &c., ‘and yet with my ears this was the report of you
Ihad before heard-'tis well known among meu) The last clause is
parenthetical, glaream is explained by v. 829. Aunbus is not otiose
but points the contrast opera expertus )( auribus acceperam.

888. otum damme etque 80111818,οε a judge passing sentence
on them and humbling their pride. Charmides was returning rich,
therefore if Neptune had been true to his reputation he could not hope
for mercy. But he found the reputation was not true, and therefore
praises Neptune.

The fragment that follows v. 830 has no place here, for Charmides is
nu poor or a beggar, ‘mendicis cur se adnumeret nulla eausa!

880. 8111188110, ‘get along, 1 praise you.’ Abi is usually an ex·
pressiori of dissatisfaction and blame, as Mil. ²91 011,οΜ mrisinrile
dreis, ‘comel comet what you sayis improbable,’ ibid. 314 abi, ludis nte,
‘cornel comel you're making lun of me! But in places abi is ‘undum
cum laudatione blarutientis,² as Asin. 704 em sic: abi, 101010, Ter. Ad.
564 100010, Ctesipho, patrissas: abi, uirum te indua, where Donatus
explains, quasi 111001, ‘nan est cur te morer!

0111118818808011181, ‘you know how to treat people according to
their station, as is right.’ That is to say, you do not diuites damnas
atque damas, but treat each with the respect that is his due. Scis
tractare, like Pers. 761 beneficium scit accipere et reddere nescit.

888. teus tutati: infidum 8888 iterant. These are contrasted
clauses—see on v. apa—‘you have been faithful (to me), though people
declare that you are faithless!

eptqtte toret 18, ‘had it not been for you.' Absque is used by
Plautus and Terence so as to imply a conditional clause=st¹ sine te, and
the verb esset or seret is impersonal, so that absque 1010οε11 tu nara
esses. So Bacch. 411, Capt. 754, Men. 1001, Pers. 836 &c Absque
is revived by silves-age writers and used without a verb, so that absque
me=sme me.

888. dhone tultaent=distutissentquu the prep. is separated from
its verb by tmesis, as in 01 uos sacra=0bsecra uas. This is a feature of
the older stage of every langnage. See Lindsay‚ L. L. p. 57 3, who
quotes ‘sub ues placo,' the 01011810 phrase for supplica retained in Latin
prayers; transque data and credeque plorato, legal archaisms for traditoque
and implorataque.

1818111188. Neptune’s ‘myrmidons’ or ‘ministering spirits' are the
winda and storms. Suttttets, the first shortening likesagtttas v. 72 5,
the second like turtints v. 835.
