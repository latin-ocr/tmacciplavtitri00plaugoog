fi emphatic negation of Callicles’ own words, instead of nc redderes
pud strict grammar would require. The imperf. subj. is common of

ab

188. nea qul deterior esset tacere! copiam, ‘nor ought you to have
ffl'ven him any opportunity to damage himselt’ The instrumental qui
here refers to a fem. noun copiam. For capiam facere cf. Ter. Haut.
Ptol. 28 date crescendi capiam, nouarum qui spectandi faciunt capiam,
‘give an opportunity of rising (to those) who give you an opportunity of
vihessing new plays'

188. inconciliastin, ‘have not you entangled,’ ‘inveigled into
difficultiesr' Nc=nonne,asv.1a9. In compounded with verbs is, with
hardly an exception, intensive, it is negative only with adj. and parti·
libies. Incanciliare therefore is an intensive form of conciliare, ‘to
bing to oneself,’ ‘purchase,' as v. 856. The meaning may be seen from
conciliatrix, ‘a match-maker,' ‘a woman who entraps people into
mathat hence inconciliare2‘to embarrass,’ ‘to bring into difficulties
bilingues and the like! Cf. Bacch. 551 inconciliaret copias omnis
Qtembarrassss Most. 61 3 ne inconciliare quid nas parra postules, ‘get
¹⁸¹⁰ difficulties‚’ Pers. 834 creda ea, quia nan inconciliauit quom te ema,
‘illfigued’ and so the third meaning given by Festus, p. 107 per dolum
dictitia. But Langen, Beitr'age pp. 181-183, quoting indecet=nan

‘muge’ ‘to divide.’
