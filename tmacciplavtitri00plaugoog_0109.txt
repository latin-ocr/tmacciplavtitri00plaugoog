nes, uocans munere: aliquotiens pro improbo ponitur. But cf. Mera.

the spelling inneoene for inneune (as in vv. 350 and 354) cf. moenera and
neonem, Poenus and Punicus, poeno and punire, and oenus for unm:
oe replaces older ei and later u, as coirauit, coerouit, ceeraue't. See
Lindsay‚ Latin Language‚ pp. 246-248.

fu aetam, ‘in life,' ‘in this world! Cf. v. 462 and Rud. 1235 in
aetate hominum. In this sense sometimes with a possessive gen.. but
always without the possessive pronouns, i.e. in aetate or in mate hoeni·
num, not in aetate mea &a Men. 838 qui saepe aetate in seeo dre. is
a different use.

25. conducibile, ‘advantageous’ Plautus is fond of adjs. in -bils‘s

line and morbus mores in the next, followed by mores mali iu v. 30
and metere messem maxumam in v. 32. ni inuitet, ‘did not loyalty
eall me to do so' (but loyalty dees call me to do so). The pres. subj.
expresses a state of things that really exists, a non-existent state of
things would be expressed by the imperf. So Sall. Iug. 3¹· 1 multa me
delrmtantura uobis, Quirites, ni studium reiffeble'cae omnia superet,
‘did not zeal for the commonwealth outweigh all consideratione (but
it does outweigh all).’ Tibull. 1. 4. 63 carene'na ne’ sieet, ex umere Ι
