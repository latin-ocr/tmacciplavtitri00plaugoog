100. mmdudlouuom anuum oportet nominem tollet, ‘some
ellow' with a lying tongue must be picked for the purpose! Mendacilo·
emm. see v. ooo. The line is given in A only, and by confusion on
ι scribe's part with the interpolated line v. 766 he has written in here
ileo, aster mendaciloquom olr'qucrm CA. qaid is scit facere postea?
whatever these words have ousted‚ there must have been a word like
ponci to be followed by au infin. and the aces. mmdaciloquom, &a
Oportet may be regarded as certain. Oportet hominem deligi is the
supplement suggested by Leo. Ritschl suggested-to much the same
purport—esse homoinem mmet desoro. For dc foro cf. v. 8¹5·

110. mundantem, ‘au impudent fellow.’ See on confidmh'loquius,
v. ror. -
(101) tr homo exornetur graphiae tu paramum modum, ⁸ let this
fellow be got up perfectiy in foreign fashiou.’ With the transposition of
this line from 767 to this place the passage runs smoothly. First the
man’s appearance isdesoribed v. 768, then his character v. 769. Next,
the-person being 61160011, he is to be dressed for his part and instructed
vhat he is to do. Exommrc is the technical word used of dressing up
aetors for their part.

crapulae, a pseudo-Greek adv„ with a Latin termination like those
quoted ou v. 625. from graphicus (γραφικός). Graphicus means as like
as a picture is hire its original. So v. 936 graphicum nugatorem, ‘a
perfect picture'of a humbug‚’ ‘the beau idial oi a humbug‚’ v. 1014
graphicum jurem, ‘a living picture of a thief‚’ v. 1139 pergraphicus
sycophanta, Epid. 410 ¹semrom graphicum. ‘an ideal siave‚' Stich. 570
graphicum mortalem, ‘a picture of a man! The adv. graphice, Pers.
306 nunc ego huic graphice facetus fiam. So here graphice is dressed
procisely -as a foreiguer ought to be dressed, so as to maire him a living
picture of aforeigner 3 perhaps tout-isaii will render the adverb.

111. ummmaseemro. - ⁴

m 1101110 utris, ‘in his father's name‚’ ‘from his father)

111. flium bene sorore rm, &c- Oratio obliqua aster nuntiet.
‘Tell him that his father is doing well, 816.ι Illum here aud cum iu the

rot. tltt=Leshomka Hiatus at the caesura is legitimare, and itis
unnecessary to change illi to illic.
